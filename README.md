# OmniAuth Twitter

This gem contains the Twitter strategy for OmniAuth.

Twitter uses the OAuth 1.0a flow, you can read about it here: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 1.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-twitter'

You can pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-twitter', :git => 'https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-twitter.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :twitter, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret" 
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Twitter (they call them API Key and Secret Key). 

Twitter also optionally supports specifying a username when authenticating. This is handy when your application supports multiple twitter accounts since you can prompt the user to login to the correct account (and not defaulting to the current login). 

To use this, just add a querystring for screen_name. 

	/auth/twitter?screen_name=scottw

You can also specify ```force_login``` without specifying the screen_name to prompt the user to choose the twitter account they wish to use.

    /auth/twitter?force_login=true

Twitter also optionally supports specifying a x_auth_access_type when authenticating. This is handy when you need to specify special permission in some cases.

To use this, just add a querystring for x_auth_access_type. 

	/auth/twitter?x_auth_access_type=read	


Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
